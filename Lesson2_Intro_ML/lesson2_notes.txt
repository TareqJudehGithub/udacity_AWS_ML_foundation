Machine learning is creating rapid and exciting changes across all levels of society.

It is the engine behind the recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
It allows for more accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
It powers the AI assistants you might find in your home.
It can help improve worker safety.
It can speed up drug design.

What is Machine Learning (ML)?
 - ML is a modern software development technique. 
 - ML is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve
   problems by using examples of real-world data.
 - ML allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without 
   being explicitly programmed to do so.
 - ML is how computers learn from data to discover patterns and make predictions.
 - ML automates some of the statistical reasoning and pattern-matching the 
   problem solver would traditionally do.
 - ML overall goal is to use a model created by a model training algorithm to generate predictions 
   or find patterns in data that can be used to solve a problem.  
 - ML techniques:
     1. Supervised Learning
      - Every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or 
        output value associated with it.
      -  the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

     2. Unsupervised learning
      - There are no labels for the training data.
      - A ML algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions 
        that govern the data.
     
     3. Reinforcement learning
      - The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to 
        maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a 
        specific goal. 
      - This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised 
        learning.
